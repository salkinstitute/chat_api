# What's this all about
This is a API built to provide AI Agent based on company data sources and system prompts who also has access to custom defined tools.
The ingress and egress for the Agent is currently through a Slackbot and a REST API (FastAPI). 
Full [roadmap](https://github.com/salkinstitute/chat_api/edit/main/planning.md) still being determined.

# Why?
Things are moving very fast with AI and it's potential keeps expanding.  This is a hands-on way to explore that potential and work directly with several different approaches with AI simultaneously until best practices are established.
